## How it started

A few months ago, I was building a commercial project for a client. I needed to use Laravel for sure.  
But I also wanted to use Angular to make the UI reactive & I was particularly interested in the powerful components offered by Angular Material.  

After spending over 40 hours on the setup for Laravel & Angular (which by the way, wasn't that good), 
I noticed that open sourcing this setup would benefit a lot of users.  

A few weeks later, it got featured on [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/2015/05/laravel-and-angular-material-starter-project/){:target="_blank"}. Since then, people started opening issues and tinkering with it.

The top priority has been to provide people with best practices for Angular apps that use a Laravel API. I can't claim that it's perfect, so if you have some feedback make sure to open a new issue!

## What's next

In a couple of weeks, **version 3.2** will be out. It will feature out of the box JWT Authentication and password resets. Here's what has been [added so far](https://github.com/jadjoubran/laravel5-angular-material-starter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changelog){:target="blank"}.

I'm also working on better documentation by adding beginner friendly installation and more screencasts.

## What about Angular 2?

Angular 2 is just around the corner. Hence the next logical step is to start working on Angular 2 with typescript support. This will become a priority as soon as 3.2 is released!

## Anonymous survey

Community feedback has always been very important. That's why I put together a 1 minute anonymous survey. No name, no email. I would love to know more how you're using this starter project and how it can be improved.
