title: NDC Oslo - Scaling large Angular apps
---

I'm excited to announce that I'll be presenting **[Scaling Large Angular Apps](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/scaling-large-angular-apps/){:target="_blank"}** in **[NDC Oslo](http://ndcoslo.com/){:target="_blank"}** - Norway.

NDC Oslo is one of the biggest developer conferences in Europe. With more than 150 speakers this year, covering over 40 technologies.

Here's the abstract of my talk:

> Scaling beyond the To Do list App of Angular JS. Although Angular JS is a powerful framework, we still need conventions, automation and a variety of tools to make it scale. Especially in a team environment. Learn how to scale your angular apps with simple but effective techniques, endorsed by the Angular community.
> 
> This talk will include concepts applicable to both newest angular versions (2 and 1.5)
