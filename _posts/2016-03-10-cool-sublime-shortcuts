title: Cool Sublime Shortcuts
---


I would like to share some of the sublime shortcuts that I use everyday.

I would recommend that you learn a new one everyday.

	If you're on Windows or Linux, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> instead of <kbd>Cmd</kbd>
</p>


### Go to Anything

Let's start with the most used sublime keyboard shortcut:


<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

Assuming that you have a folder or a project open in Sublime Text, you'll be able to start typing the name of any file that you want to navigate to.  
Try to skip some characters in the file name, you'll still find it! It uses a technique called Fuzzy searching.


### Command Palette

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

This command brings up the Command Palette. Which is basically a portal to almost any command you could run in Sublime Text.  
Try toggling the word wrap with `Word Wrap: Toggle`.  
Remember this is also using Fuzzy searching.   
You can try and reindent your file automatically by bringing up your command palette and then running `Reindent lines`.
