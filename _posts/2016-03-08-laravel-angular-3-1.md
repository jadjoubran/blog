---

[Laravel Angular Material Starter](http://laravel-angular.io){:target="_blank"} has recently hit version 3.1  
I would like to thank all the contributors and users for making it possible.

### What's new?

Here are some of the goodies available as of v3.1:

* Based on a fresh Laravel 5.2 installation
* Angular 1.5 (with components support)
* Improved folder structure for components & pages
* Faster Elixir task
* EcmaScript 6 support (thanks to [@jadsalhani](https://github.com/jadsalhani){:target="_blank"})

Your EcmaScript 6 code will be transpiled into browser compliant EcmaScript 5 code.

Checkout the [official documentation](https://laravel-angular.readme.io/docs/overview#whats-new-in-31){:target="_blank"} for more info.

### What's next?

Expect some detailed screencasts very soon!

The main features planned for version 3.2 will be an awesome `artisan ng:auth` generator and/or an out of the box JWT authentication. Feel free to mention what you would like to see as a new feature in the comments below!
